# MSAN 694 Project

This repository contains files for the MSAN 694 Distributed Computing final project. The reposistory contains a number of Jupyter Notebook files that document work to investigate a Python graph data structure and methods to download and process data from OpenStreetMap. Files used for development are in appropriately named subdirectories.

Files that demonstrate each of the three methods tested include:
* Python Method.ipynb
* Another one
* And a third

Feel free to change this README as you want!
